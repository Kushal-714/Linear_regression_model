# Sales-Forecasting

I made this jupyter notebook to forecast bike accesorries revenue using linear regression model.

Riding accesory dataset contain different features like date, year, month, customer age, gender, country, state, product category, sub category, quantity, unit price, cost, revenue.

I had perform feature selection, Encoding to convert categorical data into numerical data because linear regression model works on only numerical data, removed null values, standardization to bring all values near to 1, splitting of dataset into train and test data, at last evaluation of trained model.
